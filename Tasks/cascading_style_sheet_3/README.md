Pylon Esports is the official esports organization of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP). They represent PUP in various esports competitions, including:

- 🎯 **Valorant**  
- 📱 **Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB)**  
- 🏹 **League of Legends (LoL)**  

## ❓ Problem

From the previous group collaboration modify
your output and apply CSS box model in each of
webpages.

## ⚙️ How we utilize this
Throughout Part 1 and Part 2 of our group collaboration, we have consistently utilized the CSS Box Model to organize and structure our website effectively to make the content aesthetically pleasing.

How We Used the Box Model:

✔ Padding – Provided spacing inside elements for better readability, which heavily utilized on the buttons and container.

✔ Border – Defined clear boundaries between sections.

✔ Width & Height – Controlled element sizing for consistency across pages and prevent overlapping from other elements .

✔ Content – Ensured text and images fit properly within their containers especially in Landing pages.
